## What is The Power?
The Power is a collection of scripts that showcase the GitHub APIs to create a usefully configured GitHub organization. The Power adds the following to a blank appliance or organization in <=30 seconds:

* Users
* A [team](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams) of users.
* [Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo): a private repository.
* A private repository called *testrepo* with a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) called *new_branch*,  a protected branch called *protected_branch*
* [Branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches) rules set up on `protected_branch`.
* A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on *testrepo*.
* A working [*CODEOWNERS*](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) file configured for the *README.md* file on *testrepo*.
* A [webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks) on *testrepo* that outputs to a smee.io url.
* A [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository).
* GitHub Pages configured for *testrepo*.
